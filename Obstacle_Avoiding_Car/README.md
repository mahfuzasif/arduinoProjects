## Description
An automated obstacle avoiding car project. This detects obstacle on 3 sides: straight front, front-left and front-right sides by the help of 3 sonar sensors. If any obstacle is detected, it avoids that side and goes to any open side.

## Components
Materials used for this project are as follows-
1. Arduino Uno
2. Sonar Sensors (HCSR04)
3. L293 Dual DC Motor Controller
4. DC Geared motors(120rpm)
5. Rechargeable Battery Unit
6. Directional Wheels
7. Motor Supports
8. Robot Chassis (Arcylic, Transparent)
9. Micro SD Card Adapter
10. SD Card (for data logging)
11. Bolts, Nuts and Jumper Wires
